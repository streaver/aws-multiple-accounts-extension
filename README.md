# AWS Multiple Accounts Extension

If you use multiple AWS Accounts via the SSO dashboard at *.awsapp.com you may have noticed that after you select an account a new tab is opened but there is no immediate way of knowing in which account you are logged in, you only get the account id.

This extension solves this. It will automatically get all the accounts available in *.awsapp.com and once you are in *.aws.amazon.com it will prepend the account name to your role.
